# Tour Of Heroes

`TOH` by John Papa built only with Webpack 4. This project uses `@ngtools/webpack` to work with Angular specific bundling (`.ts`, `.html`, `.css`, `.scss` files).

The Webpack configuration file supports string type checking within VSCode thanks to `@ts-check` pragma.

## TODO

- [ ] split Webpack configuration as per best pracises section
- [ ] Webpack dev server support
- [ ] prod/dev/test builds
- [ ] drop-in replacement with `@angular-devkit/build-webpack`
